# Document Search
document searcher that uses an inverted index and vectors to find relevant documents from queries

An inverted index is an index data structure storing a mapping from content, such as words or numbers, to its locations in a document or a set of documents. In simple words, it is a hashmap like data structure that directs you from a word to a document or a web page.
